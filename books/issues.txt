Dense/fully connected layer: 
	A linear operation on the layer’s input vector.

Convolutional layer: 
	A layer that consists of a set of “filters”. The filters take a subset of the input data at a time, but are applied across the full input (by sweeping over the input). The operations performed by this layer are still linear/matrix multiplications, but they go through an activation function at the output, which is usually a non-linear operation.
	
Pooling layer: 
	We utilise the fact that consecutive layers of the network are activated by “higher” or more complex features that are exhibited by a larger area of the networks input data. A pooling layer effectively down samples the output of the prior layer, reducing the number of operations required for all the following layers, but still passing on the valid information from the previous layer.
	
Normalisation layer: 
	Used at the input for feature scaling, and in batch normalisation at hidden layers.


current issues in society:

Do you think recommendation engines is the biggest threat to society in ML?

Given Youtube’s current rec algorithm (the more seconds the user stays on the video, the higher the rank, the more likely the video is promoted to an identified user with similar tastes), the problem you’ve identified here is one we’ve had before the ML frenzy - media sensationalism.

In effect, cable works on the same system. The longer they can keep viewers on the channel, the more valuable their ad real estate. Keeping users engaged is then more important over honest representation of truth. Outrage and fear are the most effective human emotions to lengthen engagement, hence... everything in the US right now, really.

Other rec algorithms are a bit more removed from this, imo, as they don’t optimize for “engagement” in the same method as cable news.


the consequence? 
and the solution?
